Problem statement :
    
A certain food-based company conducted a survey with the help of a fitness 
company to find the relationship between a personâ€™s weight gain and the 
number of calories they consumed in order to come up with diet plans for 
these individuals. Build a Simple Linear Regression model with calories 
consumed as the target variable. Apply necessary transformations and record
the RMSE and correlation coefficient values for different models. 

'''
'''
Business Objective :

Maximize : The accuracy of the diet plan for the person by calculating the calories
burn and the relationship between the weight and the calories burn

Minimize : The weight of the customer by giving the proper diet plan so it can
easy to trainer for advice the proper diet

Business contraints : The suitable diet plan and exercise suggestion to the customer.
