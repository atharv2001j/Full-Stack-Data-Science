Problem Statement :
    A certain university wants to understand the relationship between 
    studentsâ€™ SAT scores and their GPA. Build a Simple Linear Regression
    model with GPA as the target variable and record the RMSE and correlation
    coefficient values for different models.

'''
'''
Business Objective :

Maximize : The GPA of the students so the progress of the student will be monitored
and require action plan will be taken

Minimize : The Bad Performance of the studen score

Business Contraints : The correct data to predict the GPA and the SAT score
